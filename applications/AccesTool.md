## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Over 96.8% of websites fail WCAG compliance, excluding millions with disabilities. The problem is even more severe in Web3, where decentralized applications (dApps) rely on dynamic content, blockchain interactions, and custom interfaces, rendering traditional accessibility tools ineffective.

Beyond ethical concerns, inaccessibility leads to legal liabilities, regulatory penalties, and economic losses. The 2025 European Accessibility Act mandates strict penalties (up to 6% of global revenue) for non-compliant businesses. In the U.S., non-compliance results in missed revenue exceeding $13 billion annually and an increasing number of lawsuits.

Existing solutions, such as manual audits and traditional tools, are slow, costly, and not focused on Web3, highlighting the need for a decentralized, AI-driven approach.

AccessTool bridges the digital divide in Web3 by ensuring accessibility for all users, empowering developers, and reducing compliance risks.

### Project Details

**Introducing AccessTool**

AccessTool aims to leverage AI and blockchain to automate and decentralize web accessibility compliance for Polkadot and Web3. It provides:

- AI-powered scans & one-click fixes for rapid compliance (e.g., AI auto-generates missing alt text using NLP, suggests correct ARIA labels, or dynamically adjusts contrast levels using Computer Vision).
- On-chain verifiable audits for transparency and legal protection.
- Cross-platform integration via Polkadot’s smart contracts and XCM.

**Why Polkadot?**

Polkadot’s interoperability, scalability, and governance make it ideal for AccessTool. By leveraging XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging), accessibility data can be shared across multiple chains, ensuring a unified Web3 compliance standard.

- Scalability: Cost-efficient large-scale audits through Polkadot parachains.
- Interoperability: dApps, wallets, and parachains can integrate decentralized audits seamlessly.
- Security & Transparency: Immutable blockchain-verified compliance records, enabling regulators and businesses to instantly verify accessibility status, reducing legal risks.

**How It Works**

1. **Submit URL**: Users upload their Web3 dApp or traditional website for scanning.
2. **AI Scans for Accessibility Issues**: The AI detects WCAG violations such as missing alt text, keyboard traps, and contrast issues.
3. **Compliance Report**: Users receive a detailed report with an accessibility score and suggested fixes.
4. **Fixes**: One-click fixes automatically address common accessibility issues.
5. **Verification**: Compliance status is stored on Polkadot via smart contracts.
6. **Data Sharing**: XCM enables parachains to verify and share compliance records.

**Decentralized Audits & Platform Integration**

- Results stored on-chain via smart contracts for transparency and legal protection.
- Bridges Web2 and Web3 with scalable, cost-effective accessibility solutions.

**Technology Stack**

Blockchain Layer (Polkadot)

- Polkadot Parachain (Substrate): Scalable, low-cost audits.
- XCM: Cross-chain data sharing.
- Smart Contracts (ink): On Polkadot/Substrate, these smart contracts securely store and verify accessibility compliance data. They ensure that compliance records are permanent and easily auditable by third parties, providing both legal protection and transparency."

**AI Accessibility Engine**

- Computer Vision & NLP (TensorFlow/PyTorch): Detects WCAG violations.

**Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

The MVP will deliver a functional tool for Polkadot developers, featuring AI-powered detection of accessibility issues and on-chain reporting. It targets accurate identification of WCAG violations in Web3 dApps and websites, **with results logged on Polkadot’s blockchain for transparency. Includes suggested one-click fixes for simple issues to significantly reduce manual effort, with full automation planned in later phases.**

### Ecosystem Fit

AccessTool integrates into the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem as a Web3 accessibility solution, leveraging blockchain for tamper-proof audits and XCM for interoperability.

**Target Audience**

- Parachain teams
- dApp & wallet developers
- Enterprises & regulators
- End-users with disabilities

**Impact & Alignment with Polkadot’s Vision**
AccessTool will bridge a critical accessibility gap in Web3 while advancing Polkadot’s mission of an inclusive blockchain ecosystem. By ensuring decentralized applications, wallets, and websites meet WCAG standards, it reduces social exclusion, legal risks, and economic losses caused by inaccessible digital experiences. AccessTool enhances parachain adoption by ensuring dApps meet regulatory standards, reducing barriers to enterprise use.

**Identified Via**

- **WebAIM 2024 Report** – 96.8% of websites fail WCAG compliance.
- **EU Accessibility Act (2025)** – Strict legal penalties for non-compliance.
- **Lawsuits & Settlements** – High-profile cases (Domino’s, Beyoncé’s website) highlight legal risks.
- **User Feedback & Surveys** – Accessibility barriers prevent full engagement with dApps and Web3 platforms.

**Uniqueness & Competitive Edge**

No direct competitors in the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem focus exclusively on Web3 accessibility compliance. Existing projects address usability and UI/UX but lack automated WCAG audits, smart contract-driven verification, and cross-chain accessibility data sharing.

Unlike Web2 tools (e.g., WAVE, Siteimprove), AccessTool offers:

- AI-powered fixes (vs. manual audits).
- Cross-chain accessibility data sharing.
- Integration with decentralized ecosystems.

This makes AccessTool a one of a kind dedicated Web3 accessibility solution in the Polkadot ecosystem.
